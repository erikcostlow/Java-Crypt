# Java-Crypt
A tool to handle a number of tasks that I regularly do for cryptography and applications.
# Look through keystores and certificates
## Compare certificates and keystores
# Look at Java archives to see what they are: JARs, WARs, and EARs
## Piece together graphs: hierarchies, control flow, data flow, etc.
